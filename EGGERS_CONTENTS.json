{"home":{"content":"# Programming For Non-Programmers\n---\n\nHello, Wrold! Welcome to class. Today and tomorrow, we will take a deep dive into the world of web programming.\n\n#### Main Goals\n---\n1. Learn key concepts and terminology of the industry.\n2. Understand how the web works on a high level\n3. Build well structured, practically styled static web pages\n4. Build a simple, dynamic API powered webpage.\n\n#### Day One\n---\n\n* #### [Essential Terminology](#essential-terminology)\n* #### [Setting Up Your Environment]()\n* #### [Guts of an HTTP Request]()\n* #### [Deploying to the internets]()\n* #### [HTML Basics]()\n* #### [Semantic HTML]()\n* #### [Practical CSS3 Guidelines]()\n* #### [Styling for various Screens]()\n\n\n#### Day Two\n---\n\n**Up to you!** We can either:\n\n1. Learn basics of **javascript**. This might be easiest since you will be able to build out interactive webpages from scratch thanks to our adventures from **Day One**.\n\n2. Building something **serverside**. We will only be able to make something simple since we won't have a solid grasp on programming logic. However, this will allow you to understand how the backend generates webpages for the client.\n\n**Your call!** Based on your feedback, I will tailor **Day Two** curriculum.\n\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"PFNP","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"A crash course on web development.","idx":2},"essential-terminology":{"content":"# Essential Terminology\n---","idx":3},"setting-up-your-environment":{"content":"# Setting Up Your Environment\n---","idx":4},"guts-of-an-http-request":{"content":"# Guts of an HTTP Request\n---","idx":5},"deploying-to-the-internets":{"content":"# Deploying to the internets\n---\n","idx":6},"html-basics":{"content":"# HTML Basics\n---","idx":7},"semantic-html":{"content":"# Semantic HTML\n---\n","idx":8},"practical-css3-guidelines":{"content":"# Practical CSS3 Guidelines\n---","idx":9},"styling-for-various-screens":{"content":"# Styling for various Screens\n---\n","idx":10},"__list__":["home","title","desc","essential-terminology","setting-up-your-environment","guts-of-an-http-request","deploying-to-the-internets","html-basics","semantic-html","practical-css3-guidelines","styling-for-various-screens"]}
