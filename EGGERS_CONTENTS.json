{"home":{"content":"# Programming For Non-Programmers\n---\n\nHello, Wrold! Welcome to class. Today and tomorrow, we will take a deep dive into the world of web programming.\n\n#### Main Goals\n---\n1. Learn key concepts and terminology of the industry.\n2. Understand how the web works on a high level\n3. Build well structured, practically styled static web pages\n4. Build a simple, dynamic API powered webpage.\n\n#### Day One\n---\n\n* #### [Essential Terminology](#essential-terminology)\n* #### [Setting Up Your Environment](#setting-up-your-environment)\n* #### [Guts of an HTTP Request](#guts-of-an-http-request)\n* #### [Deploying to the internets](#deploying-to-the-internets)\n* #### [HTML Basics](#html-basics)\n* #### [Semantic HTML](#semantic-html)\n* #### [Practical CSS3 Guidelines](#practical-css3-guidelines)\n* #### [Styling for various Screens](#styling-for-various-screens)\n\n\n#### Day Two\n---\n\n**Up to you!** We can either:\n\n1. Learn basics of **javascript**. This might be easiest since you will be able to build out interactive webpages from scratch thanks to our adventures from **Day One**.\n\n2. Building something **serverside**. We will only be able to make something simple since we won't have a solid grasp on programming logic. However, this will allow you to understand how the backend generates webpages for the client.\n\n**Your call!** Based on your feedback, I will tailor **Day Two** curriculum.\n\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"PFNP","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"A crash course on web development.","idx":2},"essential-terminology":{"content":"# Essential Terminology\n---","idx":3},"setting-up-your-environment":{"content":"# Setting up your Environment\n---\n\nWe will first set up the tools and resources we need to succeed in class. Then, we will set up tools and resources needed to write code.\n\n### Setting up your classroom environment\n---\nPlease set up a **[GitHub](https://www.github.com)** account. **Make sure you also verify your email** after setting up your account.\n\nI have developed a suite of tools that we will use in class to make our lives easier.\n\n\n##### [Autosync](http://autosync.io/#/course/Taq/0)\nLive class notes. For the duration of the class, all code written on my machine will be available to you in _real time_ via [Autosync](http://autosync.io/#/course/Taq/0).\n\n##### [GitBot](http://gitbot.co/#home)\nWe will use [GitBot](http://gitbot.co/#home) to deploy our webpages to the internets. You will need this in class, for homework, and generally in life.\n\n##### [Samantha](http://fewd.us/samantha/)\nSamantha is an online coding environment. We will learn javascript in [Samantha](http://fewd.us/samantha/) + it is super useful for doing quick experiments / during office hours. \n\n...There are more, but for now, these should suffice. Check out some of my writings on tools and such on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/).\n\n### Setting up your code environment\n---\n\nBefore we can begin our exercises in wizardry, we must download and install a few relevant programs.\n\nThese programs are going to help us write code, transfer code to servers, and view the results of our code in the browser.\n\n#### Sublime Text\n\n[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) &mdash; code editor &mdash; you'll be writing code here. This is a free tool, but they will ask you to donate every few saves. However, you can use the program for free as long as you'd like.\n\n#### Chrome\n[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) &mdash; web browser &mdash; you'll use this to view your code assignments. So free it hurts.","idx":4},"guts-of-an-http-request":{"content":"# Guts of an HTTP Request\n---","idx":5},"deploying-to-the-internets":{"content":"# Deploying to the internets\n---\n","idx":6},"html-basics":{"content":"# HTML Basics\n---","idx":7},"semantic-html":{"content":"# Semantic HTML\n---\n","idx":8},"practical-css3-guidelines":{"content":"# Practical CSS3 Guidelines\n---","idx":9},"styling-for-various-screens":{"content":"# Styling for various Screens\n---\n","idx":10},"__list__":["home","title","desc","essential-terminology","setting-up-your-environment","guts-of-an-http-request","deploying-to-the-internets","html-basics","semantic-html","practical-css3-guidelines","styling-for-various-screens"]}
