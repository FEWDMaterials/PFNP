{"home":{"content":"# Programming For Non-Programmers\n---\n\nHello, Wrold! Welcome to class. Today and tomorrow, we will take a deep dive into the world of web programming.\n\n#### Main Goals\n---\n1. Learn key concepts and terminology of the industry.\n2. Understand how the web works on a high level\n3. Build well structured, practically styled static web pages\n4. Build a simple, dynamic API powered webpage.\n\n#### Day One\n---\n\n* #### [Essential Terminology](#essential-terminology)\n* #### [Setting Up Your Environment](#setting-up-your-environment)\n* #### [Guts of an HTTP Request](#guts-of-an-http-request)\n* #### [Deploying to the internets](#deploying-to-the-internets)\n* #### [HTML Basics](#html-basics)\n* #### [Semantic HTML](#semantic-html)\n* #### [Practical CSS3 Guidelines](#practical-css3-guidelines)\n* #### [Styling for various Screens](#styling-for-various-screens)\n\n\n#### Day Two\n---\n\n**Up to you!** We can either:\n\n1. Learn basics of **javascript**. This might be easiest since you will be able to build out interactive webpages from scratch thanks to our adventures from **Day One**.\n\n2. Building something **serverside**. We will only be able to make something simple since we won't have a solid grasp on programming logic. However, this will allow you to understand how the backend generates webpages for the client.\n\n**Your call!** Based on your feedback, I will tailor **Day Two** curriculum.\n\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"PFNP","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"A crash course on web development.","idx":2},"essential-terminology":{"content":"# Essential Terminology\n---","idx":3},"setting-up-your-environment":{"content":"# Setting up your Environment\n---\n\nWe will first set up the tools and resources we need to succeed in class. Then, we will set up tools and resources needed to write code.\n\n### Setting up your classroom environment\n---\nPlease set up a **[GitHub](https://www.github.com)** account. **Make sure you also verify your email** after setting up your account.\n\nI have developed a suite of tools that we will use in class to make our lives easier.\n\n\n##### [Autosync](http://autosync.io/#/course/Taq/0)\nLive class notes. For the duration of the class, all code written on my machine will be available to you in _real time_ via [Autosync](http://autosync.io/#/course/Taq/0).\n\n##### [GitBot](http://gitbot.co/#home)\nWe will use [GitBot](http://gitbot.co/#home) to deploy our webpages to the internets. You will need this in class, for homework, and generally in life.\n\n##### [Samantha](http://fewd.us/samantha/)\nSamantha is an online coding environment. We will learn javascript in [Samantha](http://fewd.us/samantha/) + it is super useful for doing quick experiments / during office hours. \n\n...There are more, but for now, these should suffice. Check out some of my writings on tools and such on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/).\n\n### Setting up your code environment\n---\n\nBefore we can begin our exercises in wizardry, we must download and install a few relevant programs.\n\nThese programs are going to help us write code, transfer code to servers, and view the results of our code in the browser.\n\n#### Sublime Text\n\n[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) &mdash; code editor &mdash; you'll be writing code here. This is a free tool, but they will ask you to donate every few saves. However, you can use the program for free as long as you'd like.\n\n#### Chrome\n[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) &mdash; web browser &mdash; you'll use this to view your code assignments. So free it hurts.","idx":4},"guts-of-an-http-request":{"content":"# Guts of an HTTP Request\n---\n\n**Learning objective**: Understand how HTTP, or the HyperText Transfer Protocol, works.\n\n#### Question \nWhat happens when you type in [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) into your URL bar?\n\n#### As it turns out, a whole lot.\n\n1. Chrome has no idea what [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) actually means, so first, it looks up the **IP Address** for Google.\n2. **DNS**, or **Domain Name System**, is a phone book containing IP Addresses for all the websites that exist on the internet.\n3. Chrome then sends an **HTTP Request** to the IP address associated with Google. An HTTP Request is essentially a text message asking Google for data.\n4. Google's **server** will issues a server **Response** back to your browser. This response is parsed by Chrome (ie: should Chrome display this response data? download it? etc)\n5. **???**\n6. Profit.\n\n#### Ok great, why do we care?\n\nThere are a few key insights to take away here.\n\nFirst and foremost, the main communication mechanism for the internet &mdash; you know, that thing that rules our lives &mdash; is **text**. Literally just **letters and words and numbers and characters**.\n\nThe other main point to take away here is this: the text that is transferred is written in a highly specific manner. It follows a very strict set of rules that can be parsed and understood by the server and the browser. In other words, this text follows a **specific set of grammatical rules**.\n\nThis set of grammar is what determines a **language**. In other words, the text being passed back and forth is a specific language (**HTML**, as it turns out). The browser and server understand this language. If **we** were to learn it as well, we would be able to command the browser to do whatever we want (ie: we would be able to create webpage layouts).\n\n\n\n\n","idx":5},"deploying-to-the-internets":{"content":"# Deploying to the internets\n---\n","idx":6},"html-basics":{"content":"# HTML Basics\n---","idx":7},"semantic-html":{"content":"# Semantic HTML\n---\n","idx":8},"practical-css3-guidelines":{"content":"# Practical CSS3 Guidelines\n---","idx":9},"styling-for-various-screens":{"content":"# Styling for various Screens\n---\n","idx":10},"__list__":["home","title","desc","essential-terminology","setting-up-your-environment","guts-of-an-http-request","deploying-to-the-internets","html-basics","semantic-html","practical-css3-guidelines","styling-for-various-screens"]}
